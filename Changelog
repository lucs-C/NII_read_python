2.1 (Monday 22 August 2016)
===========================

New features
------------

  pydicom (pr/296) (Eric Kastman).

Enhancements
------------

  multiple TR values (pr/429); output of volume labels (pr/427); fix for
  some diffusion files (pr/426); option for more sophisticated sorting of
  volumes (pr/409);
* Original trackvis reader will now allow final streamline to have fewer
  points than the number declared in the header, with ``strict=False``
  argument to ``read`` function;
* Helper function to return voxel sizes from an affine matrix (pr/413);
* Fixes to DICOM multiframe reading to avoid assumptions on the position of
  the multiframe index (pr/439) (Eric M. Baker);

  (Brendan Moloney);
* More explicit error when trying to read image from non-existent file
  (pr/455) (Ariel Rokem);
* Extension to `nib-ls` command to show image statistics (pr/437) and other
  header files (pr/348) (Yarik Halchenko).

Bug fixes
---------

* Fixes to rotation order to generate affine matrices of PAR / REC files (MB,
  Gregory R Lee).

Maintenance
-----------

* Dropped support for Pythons 2.6 and 3.2;
* Comprehensive refactor and generalization of surface / GIFTI file support

  (Jasper J.F. van den Bosch, reviewed by Gregory R. Lee, MB).

API changes and deprecations
----------------------------

* Minor API breakage in original (rather than new) trackvis reader. We are now
  raising a ``DataError`` if there are too few streamlines in the file,
  instead of a ``HeaderError``.  We are raising a ``DataError`` if the track
  is truncated when ``strict=True`` (the default), rather than a ``TypeError``
  when trying to create the points array.
* Change sform code that ``parrec2nii`` script writes to NIfTI images; change
  from 2 ("aligned") to 1 ("scanner");
* Deprecation of ``get_header``, ``get_affine`` method of image objects for
  removal in version 4.0;
* Removed broken ``from_filespec`` method from image objects, and deprecated
  ``from_filespec`` method of ECAT image objects for removal in 4.0;
* Deprecation of ``class_map`` instance in ``imageclasses`` module in favor of
  new image class attributes, for removal in 4.0;
* Deprecation of ``ext_map`` instance in ``imageclasses`` module in favor of
  new image loading API, for removal in 4.0;

  ``GiftiDataArray`` methods ``get_metadata``, ``get_labeltable``,
  ``set_labeltable``; ``GiftiImage`` methods ``get_meta``, ``set_meta``.  All
  these deprecated in favor of corresponding properties, for removal in 4.0;
* Deprecation of ``giftiio`` ``read`` and ``write`` functions in favor of
  nibabel ``load`` and ``save`` functions, for removal in 4.0;
* Deprecation of ``gifti.data_tag`` function, for removal in 4.0;
* Deprecation of write-access to ``GiftiDataArray.num_dim``, and new error
  when trying to set invalid values for ``num_dim``.  We will remove
  write-access in 4.0;
* Deprecation of ``GiftiDataArray.from_array`` in favor of ``GiftiDataArray``
  constructor, for removal in 4.0;
* Deprecation of ``GiftiDataArray`` ``to_xml_open, to_xml_close`` methods in
  favor of ``to_xml`` method, for removal in 4.0;
* Deprecation of ``parse_gifti_fast.Outputter`` class in favor of
  ``GiftiImageParser``, for removal in 4.0;

  ``which_analyze_type``, in favor of new API where each image class tests the
  file for compatibility during load, for removal in 4.0.

2.0.2 (Monday 23 November 2015)
===============================

* Fix for integer overflow on large images (pr/325) (MB);
* Fix for Freesurfer nifti files with unusual dimensions (pr/332) (Chris
  Markiewicz);
* Fix typos on benchmarks and tests (pr/336, pr/340, pr/347) (Chris
  Markiewicz);

* Support for Python 3.5 (pr/363) (MB) and numpy 1.10 (pr/358) (Chris
  Markiewicz);
* Update pydicom imports to permit version 1.0 (pr/379) (Chris Markiewicz);
* Workaround for Python 3.5.0 gzip regression (pr/383) (Ben Cipollini).
* tripwire.TripWire object now raises subclass of AttributeError when trying
  to get an attribute, rather than a direct subclass of Exception.  This
  prevents Python 3.5 triggering the tripwire when doing inspection prior to
  running doctests.
* Minor API change for tripwire.TripWire object; code that checked for
  AttributeError will now also catch TripWireError.

2.0.1 (Saturday 27 June 2015)
=============================

Contributions from Ben Cipollini, Chris Markiewicz, Alexandre Gramfort,
Clemens Bauer, github user freec84.

* Bugfix release with minor new features;
* Added ``axis`` parameter to ``concat_images`` (pr/298) (Ben Cipollini);
* Fix for unsigned integer data types in ECAT images (pr/302) (MB, test data
  and issue report from Github user freec84);
* Added new ECAT and Freesurfer data files to automated testing;
* Fix for Freesurfer labels error on early numpies (pr/307) (Alexandre
  Gramfort);
* Fixes for PAR / REC header parsing (pr/312) (MB, issue reporting and test
  data by Clemens C. C. Bauer);
* Workaround for reading Freesurfer ico7 surface files (pr/315) (Chris
  Markiewicz);
* Changed to github pages for doc hosting;
* Changed docs to point to neuroimaging@python.org mailing list.

2.0.0 (Tuesday 9 December 2014)
===============================

This release had large contributions from Eric Larson, Brendan Moloney,
Nolan Nichols, Basile Pinsard, Chris Johnson and Nikolaas N. Oosterhof.

* New feature, bugfix release with minor API breakage;
* Minor API breakage: default write of NIfTI / Analyze image data offset
  value. The data offset is the number of bytes from the beginning of file
  to skip before reading the image data.  Nibabel behavior changed from
  keeping the value as read from file, to setting the offset to zero on
  read, and setting the offset when writing the header. The value of the
  offset will now be the minimum value necessary to make room for the header
  and any extensions when writing the file. You can override the default
  offset by setting value explicitly to some value other than zero. To read
  the original data offset as read from the header, use the ``offset``
  property of the image ``dataobj`` attribute;
* Minor API breakage: data scaling in NIfTI / Analyze now set to NaN when
  reading images.  Data scaling refers to the data intercept and slope
  values in the NIfTI / Analyze header.  To read the original data scaling
  you need to look at the ``slope`` and ``inter`` properties of the image
  ``dataobj`` attribute.  You can set scaling explicitly by setting the
  slope and intercept values in the header to values other than NaN;
* New API for managing image caching; images have an ``in_memory`` property
  that is true if the image data has been loaded into cache, or is already
  an array in memory; ``get_data`` has new keyword argument ``caching`` to
  specify whether the cache should be filled by ``get_data``;
* Images now have properties ``dataobj``, ``affine``, ``header``. We will
  slowly phase out the ``get_affine`` and ``get_header`` image methods;
* The image ``dataobj`` can be sliced using an efficient algorithm to avoid
  reading unnecessary data from disk.  This makes it possible to do very
  efficient reads of single volumes from a time series;
* NIfTI2 read / write support;
* Read support for MINC2;
* Much extended read support for PAR / REC, largely due to work from Eric
  Larson and Gregory R. Lee on new code, advice and code review. Thanks also
  to Jeff Stevenson and Bennett Landman for helpful discussion;
* ``parrec2nii`` script outputs images in LAS voxel orientation, which
  appears to be necessary for compatibility with FSL ``dtifit`` /
  ``fslview`` diffusion analysis pipeline;
* Preliminary support for Philips multiframe DICOM images (thanks to Nolan
  Nichols, Ly Nguyen and Brendan Moloney);
* New function to save Freesurfer annotation files (by Github user ohinds);
* Method to return MGH format ``vox2ras_tkr`` affine (Eric Larson);
* A new API for reading unscaled data from NIfTI and other images, using
  ``img.dataobj.get_unscaled()``. Deprecate previous way of doing this,
  which was to read data with the ``read_img_data`` function;
* Fix for bug when replacing NaN values with zero when writing floating
  point data as integers.  If the input floating point data range did not
  include zero, then NaN would not get written to a value corresponding to
  zero in the output;
* Improvements and bug fixes to image orientation calculation and DICOM
  wrappers by Brendan Moloney;
* Bug fixes writing GIfTI files. We were using a base64 encoding that didn't
  match the spec, and the wrong field name for the endian code. Thanks to
  Basile Pinsard and Russ Poldrack for diagnosis and fixes;
* Bug fix in ``freesurfer.read_annot`` with ``orig_ids=False`` when annot
  contains vertices with no label (Alexandre Gramfort);
* More tutorials in the documentation, including introductory tutorial on
  DICOM, and on coordinate systems;
* Lots of code refactoring, including moving to common code-base for Python
  2 and Python 3;
* New mechanism to add images for tests via git submodules.

1.0.0 (Thursday, 13, Oct 2010)
==============================

* This is the first public release of the NiBabel package.
* NiBabel is a complete rewrite of the PyNifti package in pure python.  It was
  designed to make the code simpler and easier to work with. Like PyNifti,
  NiBabel has fairly comprehensive NIfTI read and write support.
* Extended support for SPM Analyze images, including orientation affines from

* Bugfix: NiftiFormat.vx2s() used the qform not the sform. Thanks to Tom
  Holroyd for reporting.

0.20100412.1 (Mon, 12 Apr 2010)
===============================

* Bugfix: Unfortunate interaction between Python garbage collection and C
  library caused memory problems. Thanks to Yaroslav Halchenko for the
  diagnose and fix.

0.20090303.1 (Tue, 3 Mar 2009)
==============================

* Bugfix: Updating the NIfTI header from a dictionary was broken.
* Bugfix: Removed left-over print statement in extension code.
* Bugfix: Prevent saving of bogus 'None.nii' images when the filename
  was previously assign, before calling NiftiImage.save() (Closes: #517920).
* Bugfix: Extension length was to short for all `edata` whos length matches
  n*16-8, for all integer n.

0.20090205.1 (Thu, 5 Feb 2009)
==============================

* This release is the first in a series that aims stabilize the API and
  finally result in PyNIfTI 1.0 with full support of the NIfTI1 standard.
* The whole package was restructured. The included renaming
  `nifti.nifti(image,format,clibs)` to `nifti.(image,format,clibs)`. Redirect
  modules make sure that existing user code will not break, but they will
  issue a DeprecationWarning and will be removed with the release of PyNIfTI
  1.0.
* Added a special extension that can embed any serializable Python object
  into the NIfTI file header. The contents of this extension is
  automatically expanded upon request into the `.meta` attribute of each
  NiftiImage. When saving files to disk the content of the dictionary is also
  automatically dumped into this extension.
  Embedded meta data is not loaded automatically, since this has security
  implications, because code from the file header is actually executed.
  The documentation explicitely mentions this risk.
* Added :class:`~nifti.extensions.NiftiExtensions`. This is a container-like
  handler to access and manipulate NIfTI1 header extensions.
* Exposed :class:`~nifti.image.MemMappedNiftiImage` in the root module.
* Moved :func:`~nifti.utils.cropImage` into the :mod:`~nifti.utils` module.
* From now on Sphinx is used to generate the documentation. This includes a
  module reference that replaces that old API reference.
* Added methods :meth:`~nifti.format.NiftiFormat.vx2q` and
  :meth:`~nifti.format.NiftiFormat.vx2s` to convert voxel indices into
  coordinates defined by qform or sform respectively.
* Updating the `cal_min` and `cal_max` values in the NIfTI header when
  saving a file is now conditional, but remains enabled by default.
* Full set of methods to query and modify axis units. This includes
  expanding the previous `xyzt_units` field in the header dictionary into
  editable `xyz_unit` and `time_unit` fields. The former `xyzt_units` field
  is no longer available. See:
  :meth:`~nifti.format.NiftiFormat.getXYZUnit`,
  :meth:`~nifti.format.NiftiFormat.setXYZUnit`,
  :meth:`~nifti.format.NiftiFormat.getTimeUnit`,
  :meth:`~nifti.format.NiftiFormat.setTimeUnit`,
  :attr:`~nifti.format.NiftiFormat.xyz_unit`,
  :attr:`~nifti.format.NiftiFormat.time_unit`
* Full set of methods to query and manuipulate qform and sform codes. See:
  :meth:`~nifti.format.NiftiFormat.getQFormCode`,
  :meth:`~nifti.format.NiftiFormat.setQFormCode`,
  :meth:`~nifti.format.NiftiFormat.getSFormCode`,
  :meth:`~nifti.format.NiftiFormat.setSFormCode`,
  :attr:`~nifti.format.NiftiFormat.qform_code`,
  :attr:`~nifti.format.NiftiFormat.sform_code`
* Each image instance is now able to generate a human-readable dump of its
  most important header information via `__str__()`.
* :class:`~nifti.image.NiftiImage` objects can now be pickled.
* Switched to NumPy's distutils for building the package. Cleaned and
  simplified the build procedure. Added optimization flags to SWIG call.
* :attr:`nifti.image.NiftiImage.filename` can now also be used to assign a
  filename.
* Introduced :data:`nifti.__version__` as canonical version string.
* Removed `updateQFormFromQuarternion()` from the list of public methods of
  :class:`~nifti.format.NiftiFormat`. This is an internal method that
  should not be used in user code. However, a redirect to the new method
  will remain in-place until PyNIfTI 1.0.
* Bugfix: :meth:`~nifti.image.NiftiImage.getScaledData` returns a
  unmodified data array if `slope` is set to zero (as required by the NIfTI
  standard). Thanks to Thomas Ross for reporting.
* Bugfix: Unicode filenames are now handled properly, as long as they do not
  contain pure-unicode characters (since the NIfTI library does not support
  them). Thanks to Gaël Varoquaux for reporting this issue.

0.20081017.1 (Fri, 17 Oct 2008)
===============================

* Updated included minimal copy of the nifticlibs to version 1.1.0.
* Few changes to the Makefiles to enhance Posix compatibility. Thanks to
  Chris Burns.
* When building on non-Debian systems, only add include and library paths
  pointing to the local nifticlibs copy, when it is actually built.
  On Debian system the local copy is still not used at all, as a proper
  nifticlibs package is guaranteed to be available.
* Added minimal setup_egg.py for setuptools users. Thanks to Gaël Varoquaux.
* PyNIfTI now does a proper wrapping of the image data with NumPy arrays,
  which no longer leads to accidental memory leaks, when accessing array
  data that has not been copied before (e.g. via the *data* property of
  NiftiImage). Thanks to Gaël Varoquaux for mentioning this possibility.

0.20080710.1 (Thu, 7 Jul 2008)
==============================

* Bugfix: Pointer bug introduced by switch to new NumPy API in 0.20080624
  Thanks to Christopher Burns for fixing it.
* Bugfix: Honored DeprecationWarning: sync() -> flush() for memory mapped
  arrays. Again thanks to Christopher Burns.
* More unit tests and other improvements (e.g. fixed circular imports) done
  by Christopher Burns.

0.20080630.1 (Tue, 30 Jun 2008)
===============================

* Bugfix: NiftiImage caused a memory leak by not calling the NiftiFormat
  destructor.

  text format.
* Improved Makefile.
* Included configuration and Makefile support for profiling, API doc
  generation (via epydoc) and code quality checks (with PyLint).
* Consistently import NumPy as N.
* Bugfix: Proper handling of [qs]form codes, which previously have not been
  handled at all. Thanks to Christopher Burns for pointing it out.
* Bugfix: Make NiftiFormat work without setFilename(). Thanks to Benjamin
  Thyreau for reporting.
* Bugfix: setPixDims() stored meaningless values.
* Use new NumPy API and replace deprecated function calls
  (`PyArray_FromDimsAndData`).
* Initial support for memory mapped access to uncompressed NIfTI files
  (`MemMappedNiftiImage`).
* Add a proper Makefile and setup.cfg for compiling PyNIfTI under Windows
  with MinGW.
* Include a minimal copy of the most recent nifticlibs (just libniftiio and
  znzlib; version 1.0), to lower the threshold to build PyNIfTI on systems
  that do not provide a developer package for those libraries.

0.20070930.1 (Sun, 30 Sep 2007)
===============================

* Relicense under the MIT license, to be compatible with SciPy license.
  http://www.opensource.org/licenses/mit-license.php
* Updated documentation.

0.20070917.1 (Mon, 17 Sep 2007)
===============================

* Bugfix: Can now update NIfTI header data when no filename is set
  (Closes: #442175).
* Unloading of image data without a filename set is no checked and prevented
  as it would damage data integrity and the image data could not be
  recovered.
* Added 'pixdim' property (Yaroslav Halchenko).

0.20070905.1  (Wed, 5 Sep 2007)
===============================

* Fixed a bug in the qform/quaternion handling that caused changes to the
  qform to vanish when saving to file (Yaroslav Halchenko).
* Added more unit tests.
* 'dim' vector in the NIfTI header is now guaranteed to only contain
  non-zero elements. This caused problems with some applications.

0.20070803.1 (Fri, 3 Aug 2007)
==============================

* Does not depend on SciPy anymore.
* Initial steps towards a unittest suite.
* pynifti_pst can now print the peristimulus signal matrix for a single
  voxel (onsets x time) for easier processing of this information in
  external applications.
* utils.getPeristimulusTimeseries() can now be used to compute mean and
  variance of the signal (among others).
* pynifti_pst is able to compute more than just the mean peristimulus
  timeseries (e.g. variance and standard deviation).
* Set default image description when saving a file if none is present.
* Improved documentation.

0.20070425.1 (Wed, 25 Apr 2007)
===============================

* Improved documentation. Added note about the special usage of the header
  property. Also added notes about the relevant properties in the docstring
  of the corresponding accessor methods.
* Added property and accessor methods to access/modify the repetition time
  of timeseries (dt).
* Added functions to manipulate the pixdim values.
* Added utils.py with some utility functions.
* Added functions/property to determine the bounding box of an image.
* Fixed a bug that caused a corrupted sform matrix when converting a NumPy
  array and a header dictionary into a NIfTI image.
* Added script to compute peristimulus timeseries (pynifti_pst).
* Package now depends on python-scipy.

0.20070315.1 (Thu, 15 Mar 2007)
===============================

* Removed functionality for "NiftiImage.save() raises an IOError
  exception when writing the image file fails." (Yaroslav Halchenko)
* Added ability to force a filetype when setting the filename or saving
  a file.
* Reverse the order of the 'header' and 'load' argument in the NiftiImage
  constructor. 'header' is now first as it seems to be used more often.
* Improved the source code documentation.
* Added getScaledData() method to NiftiImage that returns a copy of the data
  array that is scaled with the slope and intercept stored in the NIfTI
  header.

0.20070301.2 (Thu, 1 Mar 2007)
==============================

* Fixed wrong link to the source tarball in README.html.

0.20070301.1 (Thu, 1 Mar 2007)

===============================

* Does not depend on libfslio anymore.
* Up to seven-dimensional dataset are supported (as much as NIfTI can do).
* The complete NIfTI header dataset is modifiable.
* Most image properties are accessable via class attributes and accessor
  methods.
* Improved documentation (but still a long way to go).
